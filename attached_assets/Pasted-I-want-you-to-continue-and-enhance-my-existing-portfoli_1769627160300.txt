I want you to continue and enhance my existing portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The UI is acceptable, but the content depth, project wiring, and interactivity must be improved.

🔹 1. PROJECT ORGANIZATION (STRICT)
A. Key Projects (Show FIRST – Featured Cards)

These are my primary, high-impact projects and must appear first, with larger cards and View Details interaction:

🔹 2. “VIEW DETAILS” FUNCTIONALITY (MANDATORY)

The View Details button must NOT be static.

Required behavior:

Clicking View Details flips or expands the project card

The back/expanded view must show:

Complete tech stack

System-level tools

GitHub icon linking to the exact repo(s)

Example – AquaSentry Vision (Tech Stack to Display):

Python

TensorFlow, Keras

OpenCV (Vision Analysis)

IoT Data Processing

Alerting & Monitoring Engine

Geo-location Tagging

AI-assisted Maintenance Logic

Environmental Analytics

🔹 3. GitHub LINKS (NO PROFILE LINKS)

❌ Do NOT link to my GitHub profile

✅ Each project must link to its specific repository

Use a GitHub icon button on:

Project cards

View Details back side

Other Projects list

Open links in a new tab

🔹 7. CODE REQUIREMENTS

Use only HTML, CSS, JavaScript

No frameworks

Clean folder structure

Comment code clearly

Project data should be stored in a JS object/array for easy scaling

🔹 8. FINAL OBJECTIVE

The portfolio should clearly communicate that I am a GenAI, Multi-Agent, and MLOps engineer who builds real, production-oriented AI systems, not just demos.

Do NOT oversimplify.
Do NOT remove depth.
Do NOT collapse everything into generic cards.
